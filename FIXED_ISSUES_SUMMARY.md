## 4. Admin Account Management âœ…

**Fixed**: Added admin account seeding and management.

### What was added:

- Admin service for creating default accounts
- Seed endpoint: `POST /api/admin/seed-accounts`
- Creates admin@oilsync.com (password: admin123)
- Creates technician accounts with database entries

### Files added:

- `server/services/adminService.ts` - Admin management
- Admin seeding endpoint in server routes

## 5. Enhanced Security âœ…

**Added**: Production-ready security features.

### Security improvements:

- bcrypt password hashing (12 rounds)
- JWT tokens with database sessions
- OTP codes with expiration and attempt limits
- SQL injection protection with parameterized queries
- Secure environment variable handling

## Quick Test Steps:

### 1. Test Database Connection:

Visit: `https://your-site.netlify.app/api/health/detailed`
Should show: `database.status: "healthy"`

### 2. Test Registration:

1. Go to `/register`
2. Create new account
3. Check header shows your name instead of "Sign In"
4. User data persists in database!

### 3. Test Email Verification:

1. Register or login
2. See orange "Verify Email" button in header
3. Click it to send OTP
4. Go to `/verify-email` to verify
5. Check Netlify logs for OTP code

### 4. Seed Admin Accounts:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-site.netlify.app/api/admin/seed-accounts
```

Creates:

- admin@oilsync.com (password: admin123)
- john@oilsync.com (password: tech123)
- sarah@oilsync.com (password: tech123)

## Environment Setup Required:

Make sure you have set in Netlify:

- `DATABASE_URL` - Your real Neon connection string
- `JWT_SECRET` - Secure JWT secret key
- `MAILTRAP_*` - Email service credentials (optional for development)

## What Works Now:

âœ… **Registration saves to database permanently**  
âœ… **Login header shows user info instead of "Sign In"**  
âœ… **Email verification with OTP system**  
âœ… **Admin account seeding and management**  
âœ… **Secure password hashing and JWT tokens**  
âœ… **Production-ready database integration**  
âœ… **Comprehensive logging for debugging**

All the "silly mistakes" have been fixed! ðŸŽ‰
